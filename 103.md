# When to Stage and Commit Files in Git

Understanding when to stage and commit changes in Git is crucial for maintaining a clean and manageable project history. This guide covers the key concepts and best practices for effectively staging and committing your work.

## When to Stage Files?

You should stage files when:

- You’ve made changes to a specific file or set of files, and they are ready to be committed.
- You want to group related changes into a single commit (e.g., when working on a feature, fixing a bug, or making documentation updates).
- You want to review the changes before committing them.

### Examples:

- You’ve finished a small task within a larger project (e.g., updating the `README` file) and want to stage it for the next commit.
- You’ve made changes across multiple files but only want to commit certain parts of the work. You can selectively add specific files or use `git add -p` to stage portions of the changes.

## When to Commit Files?

You should commit when:

- You have staged all the relevant changes you want to save in a single snapshot.
- You are confident the changes represent a complete, working feature or bug fix.
- You want to create a checkpoint in the project, marking a stable state in the codebase.

### Key Considerations:

- **Commits should be atomic**: Each commit should represent a single logical change (e.g., fixing a bug or adding a feature) rather than combining unrelated changes.
- **Write meaningful commit messages**: A good commit message provides context on what the change does and why it was made.

### Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Fix issue with login validation logic"
```
